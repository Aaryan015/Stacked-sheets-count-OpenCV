## Counting stacked sheets using OpenCV

An application that automates the counting of sheet stacks in a manufacturing plant. It allows users to upload an image and then counts the number of horizontal lines in that image, displaying the result in a simple web app using Streamlit.

## Install the required dependencies
```pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy Pillow```

## Run the application in terminal:
```streamlit run main.py```

Number of sheets in the stack will be given as output
